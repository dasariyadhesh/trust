Upload your site images here.

Expected filenames (used by the app):
- /images/arulneri-1.jpg
- /images/arulneri-2.jpg
- /images/annadhanam-1.jpg
- /images/annadhanam-2.jpg
- /images/sapling-1.jpg
- /images/sapling-2.jpg

Notes:
- Place the files directly into this folder (not nested subfolders) so they are served at `/images/<filename>`.
- After uploading, restart the Next server if running in production. For dev, `npm run dev` should pick up new files automatically.
- If you want me to add placeholder images, say so and I will generate small placeholders with correct names.
